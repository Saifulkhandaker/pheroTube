        <h4 class="text-4xl mt-5 font font-semibold text-green-700">var: <span class="text-2xl text-black">"Var is a variable declaration method in JavaScript. It has function scope and global scope, but it doesn't have block scope. When a variable is declared with var inside a function, it becomes accessible throughout the entire function. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope."</span></h4>
        <h4 class="text-4xl mt-5 font font-semibold text-green-700">let: <span class="text-2xl text-black">"Let is a block scope. If it's declared within a function, then let only accessible within that function. Unlike variables declared with var, let variables are not hoisted to the top of their block.In let variable there value can be reassined after they are assigned a value."</span></h4>
        <h4 class="text-4xl mt-5 font font-semibold text-green-700">const: <span class="text-2xl text-black">Const is also a block scope.They have also limitation like let. If its declare in a function they are only accessible in that function, not outside the function. Const variable are also not hoisted to the top of the block.But there is a diference between let and const. In let variable there value can be reassined after they are assigned a value. But in a const variable there value can not be reassined after they are assigned a value.</span></h4>
